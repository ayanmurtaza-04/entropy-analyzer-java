Entropy Analyzer (Java) is a lightweight Java-based tool designed to calculate the Shannon entropy of input data such as text or binary files in order to measure their randomness and information content. By analyzing the frequency distribution of byte values and applying Shannon’s entropy formula, the tool helps identify whether data is structured, compressed, or encrypted, making it useful for educational purposes, information security studies, and basic data analysis. The project is implemented purely in Java with no external dependencies, making it easy to understand, build, and extend for students and beginners interested in information theory, cryptography, and data analysis concepts.
