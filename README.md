# Entropy Analyzer (Java)

**Entropy Analyzer** is a simple Java tool for measuring the *entropy* (randomness) of input data — files or strings — based on Shannon’s entropy formula. Entropy is a useful metric in information theory to understand how unpredictable or “random” a dataset is. High entropy typically indicates randomness, compressed data, or encrypted content.

## 📐 What Is Entropy?

Entropy is a measure of unpredictability or information content. In the context of byte data:

- Low entropy → more predictable / repeated patterns
- High entropy → random (e.g., compressed or encrypted) data
