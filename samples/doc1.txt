Universities play a critical role in shaping responsible citizens
 by promoting academic integrity and ethical learning practices. 
 Original thinking encourages students to analyze problems deeply and express ideas in 
 their own words. When learners rely on honest effort, they develop strong analytical skills,
  creativity, and confidence in their abilities. Academic honesty also strengthens trust 
  between students and instructors, creating a healthy educational environment where 
  knowledge is respected and fairly evaluated.
