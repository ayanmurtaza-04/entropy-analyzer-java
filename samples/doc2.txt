Universities play an important role in developing responsible citizens by promoting academic 
integrity and ethical learning practices. Original thinking allows students to
 analyze problems carefully and express ideas using their own words.
  When learners depend on honest effort, they build strong analytical skills, creativity, 
  and confidence in their abilities. Academic honesty also strengthens trust between 
  students and instructors, creating a positive educational environment where knowledge is 
  respected and evaluated fairly.
